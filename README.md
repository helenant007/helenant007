🌱 I am curious about your first encounter with programming.
> I was introduced to programming when I was 14 y.o. I was in junior high school and my teacher teaches us about HTML and CSS. Since then, I love to custom and learn new HTML and CSS syntaxes. The interest grow and grow, I learn PHP, MySQL, and then decided to take Computer Science as my major in University. So that's the start of my adventure to the world of 0 and 1 💻
