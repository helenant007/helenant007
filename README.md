Welcome to my profile! I'm a Software Engineer, currently specialising on Web Development. I was born and raised in western Jakarta, Indonesia. As a nocturnal person, I usually code at night, and not to mention I'm the type of friend that you'd love to talk to, about anything at 2AM, hahaha 🦉

##### 📫 FAQ: 

 🌱 *What's your current activities daily?*
> I'm currently developing and maintaining web pages at [***Tiket.com***](https://www.tiket.com), a tech start-up company from Indonesia, specialising in booking and ticketing service. 🏙️

🌱 What language that you use?
> I'm familiar with Javascript the most :)

🌱 I am curious about your first encounter with programming.
> I was introduced to programming when I was 14 y.o. I was in junior high school and my teacher teaches us about HTML and CSS. Then, I also create a blog about random teenage chit-chat, and I wonder if I can decorate it because blogger templates are boring. I am so happy to have my blog theme customized, and different from those generic template. Since then, I love to custom and learn new HTML and CSS syntaxes. The interest grow and grow, I learn PHP, MySQL, and then decided to take Computer Science as my major in University. So that's the start of my adventure to the world of 0 and 1 💻
